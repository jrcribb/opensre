"""``AgentHarness`` — consolidated agent startup for every surface.

Startup behavior for a turn-driving agent was previously scattered across
surfaces: the interactive shell, the gateway, and the investigation pipeline
each resolved integrations, loaded prior session history, and read env vars
in their own way (see ``AGENTS.md`` "Large multi-surface refactors" and
https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/opensre/issues/3359). Session lifecycle
itself — create / resolve / rotate / restore / integration hydration — is
already owned by :class:`~core.agent_harness.session.manager.SessionManager`
(issue #3357). ``AgentHarness`` sits one layer above that: it is the single
call surfaces make to get a bootstrapped session *and* the other two startup
concerns ``SessionManager`` does not own — env resolution and grounding
context — in one call, instead of each surface sequencing
``load_dotenv`` + ``SessionManager`` + its own prompt-context wiring itself.

The four responsibilities from #3359:

1. **Resolving integrations** — delegated to ``SessionManager``'s bootstrap
   (``hydrate_integrations`` / ``warm_integrations`` on :meth:`HarnessConfig`),
   plus :meth:`AgentHarness.resolve_integrations` for on-demand full resolution
   once a session exists (thin wrapper over
   :meth:`~core.agent_harness.session.state.Session.get_integrations`).
2. **Loading context** — the surface's injected
   :class:`~core.agent_harness.ports.PromptContextProvider`, if any. The
   harness does not render grounding text itself (``ports.py`` already models
   that as a per-surface concern); this step exists so surfaces get it from
   the same call as everything else.
3. **Loading previous session history from disk** — ``session_id`` +
   ``SessionManager.resolve()``, which loads the persisted session and
   restores its conversation context.
4. **Resolving env variables** — a single ``load_dotenv`` call.

This module must not import ``interactive_shell`` / ``surfaces.interactive_shell``
(enforced by ``tests/core/agent/test_import_boundaries.py``) — surfaces build a
:class:`HarnessConfig` from their own prompt-context provider and hand it in.
