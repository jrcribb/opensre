THIS MODULE NEEDS TO BE A MAXIMUM OF 100 LINES OF CODE. IF IT IS NOT, YOU WILL BE FIRED.
REMOVE ANY CODE THAT IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE ROUTER.

This module exposes one orchestration function, :func:`route_input`. Every turn
is handed to ``handle_message_with_agent``; the agent owns all behavior,
including a deterministic fast path that dispatches slash commands and aliases
without calling the LLM.
